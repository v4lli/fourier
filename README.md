# CS Applications of the Discrete Fourier Transformation

This repository contains two iPython notebooks (based on SageMath
7.5.1), showing two applications of the _discrete Fourier
Transformation_.


## DTMF tone recognition

DTMF tones, the distinct sounds associated with a certain number
on most telephone keyboards can be identified from a continous audio
stream using the Fourier Transformation.

## Lossy JPEG compression*

* Not actually DFT, but the _discrete cosine transformation_, which
is very similar.
