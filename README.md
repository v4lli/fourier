# CS Applications of the Discrete Fourier Transformation

This repository contains two iPython notebooks (based on SageMath
7.5.1), showing two applications of the _Discrete Fast Fourier
Transformation_.


## DTMF tone recognition

DTMF tones, the distinct sounds associated with a certain number
on most telephone keyboards can be identified from a continuous audio
stream using the Fourier Transformation. This is how a telephone computer
might work.

## Lossy JPEG compression\*

The original JPEG standard uses the _Discrete Cosine Transformation_ (very similar

\* Not actually DFFT, but the _discrete cosine transformation_, which
is very similar.
